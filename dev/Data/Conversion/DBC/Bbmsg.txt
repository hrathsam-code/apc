DAVID, I WAS ABLE  TO ADD SALES	DATA MISSING FROM AUG 1990 THRU
MID-1991.  THERE IS STILL MORE TO IDENTIFY AND ADD, INCLUDING THE
BALANCE	 OF 1993 DATA THAT YOU DID NOT ENTER ONTO THE PC.
	 
THE TRANSMISSION TIME IS EXCESSIVE, SO I MAY SEND YOU A	FLOPPY DISK
AND LOAD SOME DATA THAT	WAY.
	 
REGARDS, BOB
