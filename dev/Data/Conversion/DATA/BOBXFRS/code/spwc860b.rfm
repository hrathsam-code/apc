*==============================================================================
Notes for WARNINGS:
 
	 - The 8.6B release of PLBWIN.EXE requires the 8.6B SUNFHSYS.DLL to
	   execute.  If an older version of SUNFHSYS.DLL is used, then an OS
	   error occurs as follows:
 
		'The PLBWIN.EXE file is linked to missing export
		 SUNFHSYS.DLL:FhPrepIEx'

*==============================================================================
Notes for DOCUMENTATION:
 
	 - When	using the Automation Server, the 'mvNNNN' option should
	   be included in the Prog.Run command line to change the
	   virtual allocation for the server thread being executed.
 
*==============================================================================
These files have been changed as follows:
 
PLBSERVE - Ported to execute on	UNIX platforms.
 
	 - Improved performance by about 4 times for all messages dealing with
	   methods.  This directly impacts TREEVIEW and LISTVIEW so that by
	   making no changes to your PLC code these objects work much faster.
 
	 - New methods provided for the LISTVIEW object greatly improve
	   performance.  This performance increase is quite noticable with
	   PLBSERVE.  See InsertItemEx and SortColumn below.
 
	 - The 'PLBSERVE.INI' supports multiple	section	headers	to 
	   control program execution by	PLBCLIENTs that	execute	using
	   normal Windows and CE Windows devices.
 
	   The PLBSERVE	server task has	an INI file named 'PLBSERVE.INI'
	   where keywords can be specified.  Normal runtime keyword
	   definitions can be declared in this INI file	like other
	   runtimes.  The normal keywords of PLB_TERM, PLB_SYSTEM, and
	   PLB_PATH should be specified	in the PLBSERVE	ini like other
*CE SPEC*  Sunbelt runtimes.  To allow simultaneous support for	normal
	   Windows and CE Windows PLBCLIENTs, the 'PLBSERVE.INI' can
	   have	specialized sections named to support CE and non-CE
	   clients.  The 'PLBSERVE.INI'	sections can be	named as follows:
 
	      [environment]  - This section contains the basic startup
			       keywords	required to specify the	TCP/IP
			       communication parameters	to access the
			       PL/B program server.  This section also
			       includes	the required runtime keywords
			       required	(PLB_TERM, PLB_PATH, etc) to
			       execute a program for a normal Windows
			       PLBCLIENT.
 
*CE SPEC*     [env_wincepk]  - This section contains specific keywords
			       required	(PLB_TERM, PLB_PATH, etc) to
			       execute a program for a Windows CE Pocket
			       PC PLBCLIENT executable.	 This allows
			       a user to setup specialized programs,
			       screen definition files,	and pathing
			       to support Windows CE PL/B applications.
			       Also, notice that this section DOES NOT
			       include the TCP/IP communications keywords.
			       In addition to normal runtime program 
			       supported keywords, the following PLBSERVE
			       keywords	can be included	in this	section:
 
				  PLBCS_CHECKTIME
				  PLBCS_WINHIDE
				  PLBCS_MSGBUFFSIZE
				  PLBCS_LOGNAME
				  PLBCS_MAXPROGMEM
 
	 - Modified EVENTCHECK to not reset the	event check timer when
	   an event is processed and dispatched.  This change allows
	   multiple EVENTCHECK operations to be	more responsive	toward
	   processing and dispatching multiple events from the client
	   work	station.
 
	 - Corrected a problem where the second	character for the 'mv' command
	   line option that was received from the PLBCLIENT was being treated
	   as case sensitive.  If a user command line from the PLBCLIENT
	   contained an uppercase form of the 'MV' option, then	the option was
	   being ignored.
 
	 - Modified to have the	log file records terminated with an 
	   end of record compatible with the OS	executing PLBSERVE.  This
	   means that a	PLBSERVE executed on a Windows system will have
	   an EOR sequence of CR/LF while a PLBSERVE executed on a Unix
	   platform will have an EOR sequence of LF.
 
	 - Corrected a problem where an	EVENTCHECK operation was 
	   sometimes not checking the client for events.  This could
	   happen when more than 256 instructions were executed	before
	   the EVENTCHECK.  Also, this could happen if a PAUSE statement
	   preceded the	EVENTCHECK.
 
PLBCLIENT- Modified to translate and support forward byte order	messages
	   as generated	by PLBSERVE implemented	for some UNIX platforms.
 
PLBWIN	 - Modified all	runtimes to support a new UET/INI keyword named
PLB386	   'PLB_NOPATH={ON | OFF}'.  If	this keyword is	not specified,
UNIX	   then	the default action is the same as being	set to 'OFF'.
	   When	this keyword is	set to the 'ON'	state, then the	runtime
	   processing for a PREP of an AFILE or	IFILE variable will 
	   NOT STORE any pathing information into an ISI or AAM	that
	   is newly created.  This has the same	affect as specifying the
	   'NOPATH' option on the AFILE/IFILE file variable declarations.
	   When	this keyword is	set to the 'OFF' state or not specified,
	   then	a PREP operation may store pathing information into the
	   ISI/AAM file	header.
 
	 - Modified all	runtimes so that a PREP	of an IFILE will 
	   generate a command line that	is placed into the ISI header
	   when	a Key Specification is given.  If a Key	Specification
	   is not given, then a	command	line is	not generated.
 
	 - Corrected a problem where the second	character for 'm' options
	   was being treated as	case sensitive.	 This would the	'm'
	   options to be ignored if specified in an uppercase form.
 
	 - Corrected a problem in the language SORT statement that might
	   cause a GPF error when a single character key was used.
 
PLBWIN	 - Modified the	TREEVIEW object	to support new Methods and
	   properties as follows:
	   
	   TREEVIEW New	Properties:
	   
	   CHECKBOX={dnumnvar}		 (See PLBEQU.INC)
	   
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it enables check	boxes for 
	     items in a	TREEVIEW object. The object creates and	sets a state 
	     image list	with two images. State image 1 is the unchecked	box, 
	     and state image 2 is the checked box. Setting the state image to 
	     zero removes the check box	altogether. The	GetItemCheck, and 
	     SetItemCheck methods can be used when this	property is set.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. The CHECKBOX property	can only be used for CREATE and	GETPROP
		  for a	TREEVIEW object.
 
	   FULLROW={dnumnvar}		 (See PLBEQU.INC)
	   
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it enables full-row selection 
	     in	a TREEVIEW object. 
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This option cannot be	used if	the TREELNSTYLE	is not set to 
		  $NOLINES.
	     
	   HOTTRACK={dnumnvar}		 (See PLBEQU.INC)
	   
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it enables hot-track selection 
	     in	a TREEVIEW object. Hot-track selection will cause the text of 
	     any item that may be selected to be underlined
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.71 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.

	 - Modified the	LISTVIEW object	to support new Methods and
	   properties as follows:
	   
	   LISTVIEW New	Properties:
	   
	   ACTIVATE=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
 
	     When this property	is set to $ONECLICK, the LISTVIEW object
	     sends an $ITEMACTIVATE event when the user	clicks an item.	This
	     property also enables hot tracking	in the LISTVIEW	object.	
	     Hot tracking means	that when the cursor moves over	an item,
	     it	is highlighted but not selected.
 
	     When this property	is set to $TWOCLICK, the first click
	     over an unselected	item in	the LISTVIEW object selects the	item
	     and a second click	over the selected item sends a 
	     $ITEMACTIVATE event.  Every click over a selected item sends
	     a $ITEMACTIVATE event.  This property also	enables	hot
	     tracking in the LISTVIEW object.  Hot tracking means that
	     when the cursor moves over	an item, it is highlighted but
	     not selected.
	     
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This property	will only affect the operation of the
		  LISTVIEW object when the VIEWSTYLE property is set to	
		  $VIEWREPORT style.
 
 
	   CHECKBOX=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
	   
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it enables check	boxes for
	     items in a	LISTVIEW object. The object creates and	sets a state
	     image list	with two images. State image 1 is the unchecked	box,
	     and state image 2 is the checked box. Setting the state image to
	     zero removes the check box	altogether. The	GetItemCheck,
	     SetItemCheck, and FindItemCheck methods can be used when this 
	     property is set.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This property	will only affect the operation of the
		  LISTVIEW object when the VIEWSTYLE property is set to	
		    $VIEWREPORT	style.
 
 
	   GRIDLINE=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
 
	     When this property	is set to $ON, then gridlines are displayed
	     around items and subitems.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This property	will only affect the operation of the
		  LISTVIEW object when the VIEWSTYLE property is set to
		  $VIEWREPORT style.
 
 
	   HOTTRACK=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
 
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it causes those hot items 
	     that may be activated to be displayed with	underlined text.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.71 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This requires	that the ACTIVATE property be set to 
		  $ONECLICK or $TWO CLICK.
		  or $TWOCLICK.
 
	       3. This property	will only affect the operation of the
		  LISTVIEW object when the VIEWSTYLE property is set to	
		  $VIEWREPORT style.
 
 
	   HOVERSEL=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
 
	     When this property	is set to $ON, it enables hot-track selection
	     in	a LISTVIEW object. Hot track selection means that an item is
	     automatically selected when the cursor remains over the item
	     for a certain period of time.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This property	will only affect the operation of the 
		  object when the VIEWSTYLE property is	set to 
		  $VIEWREPORT style.
 
 
	   HOVERTIME=dnumnvar		   (See	PLBEQU.INC)
 
	     This property sets the time for automatic hot-track selection
	     (See the HOVERSEL property).  The time value is in milliseconds.
	     A value of 0 indicates the default time is used.
 
	     Note:
 
	       1. This property	will not take affect unless a Microsoft	file
		  version of 4.70 or later of 'comctl32.dll' is	installed on
		  a given workstation.
 
	       2. This property	will only affect the operation of the 
		  LISTVIEW object when the VIEWSTYLE property is set to	
		  $VIEWREPORT style.
 
 
	   LISTVIEW New	Methods:
 
		.------------------
		. SortColumn Method
 
		The SortColumn method sorts one	to four	columns	of 
		a LISTVIEW object.

			5 - Date Ascending
			6 - Date Descending
			7 - Time Ascending
			8 - Time Descending
			9 - Timestamp Ascending
			10 - Timestamp Descending
 
		  2. A date mask value looks for dd for	day, mm	for month,
		     yy	or yyyy	for year.  The default mask is:	mm-dd-yy
 
		  3. A time mask value looks for hh for	hour, mm for minute,
		     ss	for seconds, and xx for	100th of a second. 
		     The default mask is: hh:mm:ss.xx
 
		  4. A timestamp mask value looks for DD for day, 
		     MM	for month, YY or YYYY for year,	hh for hour,
		     mm	for minute, ss for seconds, and	xx for 100th of
		     a second.	The default mask is: YYYYMMDDhhmmssxx
 
		.--------------------
		. InsertItemEx Method
		.
 
		The InsertItemEx method	inserts	a new item into	
		a LISTVIEW object.
		
		The method uses	the following format:
 
		[label]	{object}.InsertItemEx	[GIVING	{return}]:

		     item's initial state as follows:
 
		     Value   Constant		 Initially the item ...
		     0x01    LVIS_FOCUSED	 has the focus and is 
						 surrounded by a standard
						 focus rectangle.  Although
						 more than one item may	be
						 selected, only	one item can
						 have the focus.
		      0x02    LVIS_SELECTED	 is selected.  The 
						 appearance of a selected
						 item depends on whether 
						 it has	the focus and the

	 - Corrected a problem where the second	character for the 'mv' command
	   line option was being treated as case sensitive.  If this option was
	   specified in an uppercase form, then the option was being ignored.
 
	 - Corrected a problem for the 'ErrorText' property of the
	   'Plbwin.Program' and	'Plbwin.ProgramNE' program objects for the
	   Automation Server.  The problem was that the 'ErrorText' property
	   was returning a single blank character when NO error data existed.
	   A NULL string should be returned in this case.

	 - Corrected a problem where SETMODE *F10 did not work.

	 - Corrected a problem where static objects would disappear when a
	   lower z-order tabcontrol was activated.

	 - Corrected a problem where a GETITEM for an EDITTEXT object that
	   contained highlighted text could cause a GPF error.

	 - Corrected a problem where a DISPLAY *W would	not work after a TRAP
	   occurred.

PLBCMP	 - The compiler	has been modified for every PL/B language statement
	   that generates a list of variable addresses to properly generate
	   object code when using the syntax form of
	   'Record(INDEX).MemberArray'.

	   The compiler	has been modified to properly generate object code
	   when	using the generic array	variable syntax	format
	   'Record(INDEX).ArrayRef'.  This change affects any PL/B
	   language statements that can	generate a list	of variables.

	 - Corrected a problem where an unexplained duplicate label
	   error could occur if	more than 100 variably indexed array
	   references for a FORM array used multiple calculations to
	   determine the index.

PLBDSIGN - Added support for OEM international character sets for 
	   the designer	processing.

	 - Corrected a problem where a GPF error could occur while
	   trying to perform a search operation.

	 - Corrected a problem where a	scrolling action would occur
	   when	a user clicked in a code window	after a	successful 
	   search operation.

SUNFHSYS.DLL- Modified the Isam	PREP to	generate an information
	      command line that	is inserted into the ISI header.
	      This can allow SUNIDXNT and SUNINDEX utilities to
	      use the '-i' and '-r' options for	an ISI that has
	      been PREPed by a PL/B program.
