Notes for DOCUMENTATION:
 
         - Please change the {type} field description in the Compiler
           Cross Reference to include a 'nn' type id for an Object variable.
           The Object now has a type field named 'Onn' where the 'nn'
           value is the same as identified for the subtype equates found
           in the PLBEQU.INC include file.
 
*==============================================================================
The following files have been changed as follows:
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBSERVE - Modified the socket error information stored in a server log
           file to include a client User name and Computer name.
 
         - Modified the PLBSERVE runtime to use the PLBCS_LOCALIP address
           setting in place of the PLBCS_HOSTNAME address setting when
           the PLBCS_HOSTNAME address setting is all zeros and one of the
           command options -f, -r, or -t is being used.
 
         - Modified CLOCK VERSION to append the PLBCLIENT version in
           the output DIM variable in byte positions 27 to 31.
 
         - Modified GETMODE *GUI to report a value of 0 to indicate
           no GUI support when a PLBCLIUNX client is being used.
 
         - Modified the PLBSERVE log file output to report the Admin
           Slot Identification as a decimal number.  This eliminates
           confusion comparing data reported by the ADMGETINFO statement
           to the data found in the server log file.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a SETPROP of VISIBLE=0 for a COLLECTION
           that contained a MODAL dialog WINDOW object did not execute
           properly.  This could cause the program instruction pointer to
           be invalid after the SETPROP VISIBLE=0 operation.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBCLIENT- Corrected a problem that would cause a forward byte order
           server child process to give a SEGV error when a DESTROY of a 
           WINDOW object was executed and other objects were implicitly
           destroyed.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBSERVE - Corrected a problem where a DEACTIVATE of a Modal WINDOW object
PLBCLIENT  was not properly restoring the user program stack.  This was
           causing the program instruction pointer to be invalid resulting
           in indeterminate program execution.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBWIN   - Added support for a MOVE {varlist} to {varlist1} operation.
PLBSERVE   See PLBCMP section for details.
PLB (UNIX)
 
         - Corrected a problem with the REPLACE statement caused in release
           8.7B where a replace of the same character did not set the
           ZERO flag.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the following instructions could give
           erroneous results when executed using the PLB debugger single
           step operations.
 
              CHARSAVE, CHARRESTORE
              SCRNSAVE, SCRNRESTORE, SCRNSIZE
              WINSAVE,  WINRESTORE,  WINSIZE
 
         - Corrected a problem where *JL control in a KEYIN instruction was
           affecting all of the following variables in the KEYIN.  The
           *JL should only affect the next variable in the KEYIN.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a LOADADR operation did not work
           properly when the destination variable was a VAR type and the
           variable list was a VARLIST.  The problem in this case was that 
           the address of the VARLIST was being placed into the VAR variable
           pointer.  The correction is that the address of the members of
           VARLIST is now stored into the VAR variable pointer.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBWIN   - Modified PRTPLAY to open a spool file in a READ ONLY mode.
           This can allow spool files to be processed directly off of
           a CD-ROM.
 
         - Modified the FORMLOAD instruction to allow a PANEL object to
           be specified for the optional {window} parent object.  This
           can be used to specify a PANEL object as the parent window for
           an Objects Only PLF form.  If a PANEL object is specified for
           a PLF form that is not an Objects Only form, then an O119 error
           with a subcode of 46 occurs.
 
         - Modified the TABCONTROL object to support the DOCK property.
 
         - Modified the BTRIEVE instruction to set an open state flag
           in a BFILE variable when an open function is executed 
           successfully.  When an 8.7C PLBDBUG debugger is used, this
           change allows a DV BFILE command to indicate an open state 
           for a BFILE.  Please note that a BFILE does not contain any
           information about any handles or file names specified for
           BTRIEVE function.
 
         - Modified the runtime to prevent an EVENTWAIT statement from
           continuing execution at the next PLB statement when a
           30-second keep alive check was performed.  This keep alive
           check behavior started occurring with the 8.7B patch release.
 
         - The EDITTEXT object has been modified to support the following
           new Properties and Methods.

           Note:
                1. The autoenter action does not occur if data is keyed
                   at a caret position other than the last position
                   of the edit field as determined by the MAXCHARS
                   property value.
 
                2. The autoenter action does not occur if the user sets
                   the caret to a full edit field, as determined by the
                   MAXCHARS property, and re-enters data in an OVERTYPE
                   mode.
 
         - The TEXT property has been implemented for the EDITTEXT

                The Clear method is used to delete (clear) the current
                selection for the EDITTEXT object.
 
                The method uses the following format:
 
                   [label] {object}.Clear  [GIVING {return}]
 
                Where:
 
                     label   is an optional Program Execution Label.
 
                     object  is a required EDITTEXT object to be accessed.
 
                     return  is an optional Numeric Variable that indicates
                             the success or failure of the method.
 
                Flags Affected: EOS, OVER, ZERO
 
                Note the following:

           Statements Supported:
 
                 CREATE  SETPROP  GETPROP
 
           Description:
                 This property is used to set or get the automatic entry
                 state. If the state is ON, the object automatically
                 tabs to the next object in the tab sequence when the number
                 is completed using the keyboard.  If a number has decimal
                 digits, it is considered complete when all of the decimal
                 digits have been entered.  If the value has no decimal
                 digits, then all of the integer digits must be entered.
 
           Objects Supported:
 
                 EDITNUMBER
 
           dnumnvar values:

           Description:
                 This property is used to set or get the alignment value
                 of an UpDown control component of an EDITNUMER object. If
                 the default or $UPDOWNALIGNNONE value is used, no UpDown
                 control is created. If $UPDOWNALIGNLEFT, or $UPDOWNALIGNRIGHT
                 is used, an UpDown control is created inside the EDITNUMBER
                 object by reducing the object's width.
 
                 An UpDown control only affects the integer portion of a
                 EDITNUMBER object.  The UPDOWNCHANGE, UPDOWNMAX, and
                 UPDOWNMIN properties must also be set.

         - Corrected a problem where the position/size of objects that
           used the ANCHOR property and was placed over a PANEL object
           could be changed by a FORMLOAD operation.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a GROUPBOX over a PANEL object did
           not appear after a FORMLOAD operation.
 
         - Corrected a problem where SETITEM for a TIMER object did not
           reset the timer.  This problem was caused by 8.7B changes.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a DESTROY of a MODAL form after
           a SETPROP VISIBLE=1 for a PLF form COLLECTION that included
           the MODAL form could cause a GPF error.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the border of a GROUPBOX with a
           transparent background was being drawn on top of a STATTEXT
           object that was created over the border of the GROUPBOX with
           the STATTEXT object having a higher ZORDER than the GROUPBOX.
           This problem was created in release 8.6E.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a STATTEXT object created on a PANEL
           was not being updated when a SETITEM operation was performed.
 
         - Corrected a problem where anchored objects did not properly
           redraw when the parent object was changed resulting in a
           negative height or width for the anchored object.
 
         - Corrected ANCHOR drawing problems when the AUTOSCROLL property
           was being used for the parent window of an anchored object.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the EDITHIDESEL property did not
           work when used in a CREATE for an EDITTEXT object.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the date reported for internal
           diagnostic/debug log data could have an invalid month value.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a DATALIST was not being resized
           properly when the ANCHOR and INTEGRAL properties were used
           and the parent window size was changed.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBCMP   - Modified the compiler Cross Reference output to include a type
           ID for the Object variable types.  The Object variable types
           are the same as defined for the Object subtype equated values
           found in the PLBEQU.INC include file as '$ST_object'.
 
           Example:
                    $ST_BUTTON     EQU  0x01
                    $ST_VARIANT    EQU  0x29
 
         - Modified the compiler to give a compilation error when a GOTO
           references an EXTERNAL label.  This corrects a problem where
           invalid pcode was being generated that result in a GPF error.
 
         - Modified the SWITCH, CASE, SELECT, WHEN, and FOR statements to
           allow a decimal number (dnum} to be used.
 
           Examples:
                      SWITCH   2
                       CASE    NUMVAR
                         .....
                      ENDSWITCH
 
                      SWITCH   NUMVAR
                       CASE    2
                        .....
                      ENDSWITCH
 
                      SELECT   2
                       WHEN    NUMVAR
                        .....
                      ENDSELECT
 
                      FOR NDX 1 TO 5
                       .....
                      REPEAT
 
         - Added support for a MOVE VARLIST to VARLIST operation.
 
           This MOVE instruction transfers the contents of each variable
           in the source VARLIST into the corresponding variable in the
           destination VARLIST.
 
           Format:   [label] MOVE    {source}{sep}{dest}
 
           Where:
 
                 [label]  is an optional Program Execution label.
 
                 {source} is a VARLIST Variable.
 
                 {sep}    is a comma or one of the following prepositions:
                          BY, TO, OF, FROM, USING, WITH, IN, or INTO.
 
                 (dest}   is a VARLIST Variable.
 
           Flags Affected: EOS, LESS, OVER, ZERO
 
           Note the following:
 
           1. Each VARLIST variable in the {source} is move to the
              corresponding VARIABLE in the {dest} according to the rules
              normal MOVE operation for variable types DIM, FORM, and
              INTEGER.
 
         - Modified the compiler to support the new Properties for the 
           EDITTEXT object. (See PLBWIN section for descriptions)
 
         - Modified the compiler to support new Properties for a COMBOBOX
           object. (See PLBWIN section for descriptions)
 
         - Modified the compiler to support new Properties for a DATALIST
           object. (See PLBWIN section for descriptions)
 
         - Modified the compiler to support a new GUI object named
           EDITNUMBER and its associated properties. (See PLBWIN section
           for descriptions)
 
         - Changed to allow the TEXT property for a EDITTEXT and STATTEXT
           object when using a GETPROP or SETPROP instruction.
 
         - Modified the TABCONTROL object to support the DOCK property.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the reference addresses for Global
           Array elements were invalid when the 'zc#3' compiler option
           was used.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a compilation error was occurring
           without cause for the following statement syntax when the
           'zc#3' option was used.
 
           Example:
                    VARPT   VAR   @
                    F2      FORM  2
                    .
                            TYPE  VARPT TO F2
 
         - Corrected a problem where an invalid compilation error was
           occurring for an ARRAY initialization when a comment existed
           beyond the last element and the 'zc#3' option was used.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the *ZF control did not work with
           an *DVEDIT or *DVRV control in a KEYIN.  This problem was
           created in release 8.7B.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBDBUG  - Modified the DV BFILE command to detect an open state flag
           so that an open state can be reported.  Please, note that there
           is no file name or handle information that can be reported for
           a BFILE variable.  The open state flag only indicates that
           an open function has been completed successfully by a BTRIEVE
           operation.  A close function clears the open state flag in 
           the BFILE variable.
 
         - Added EDITNUMBER to the GUI object table.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the debugger would hang indefinitely
           if a single step ( 'T' or F8 ) command was executed and the
           expression was true.
 
                'STOP IF ( S$CMDLIN = "*" )'
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBDSIGN - Modified the TABCONTROL object to support the DOCK property.
 
         - Modified to support new EDITNUMBER object.
 
         - Modified for new properties for COMBOBOX object.
 
         - Modified for new properties for DATALIST object.
 
         - Data entry via the properties editing window can now allow up to
           a 1000 characters.  The limit prior to this change was 100 
           characters.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the position/size of objects that
           used the ANCHOR property and was placed over a PANEL object
           could be changed by a FORMLOAD operation.
 
         - Corrected a problem where anchored objects did not properly
           redraw when the parent object was changed resulting in a
           negative height or width for the anchored object.

ADMEQU.INC - Added $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL0, $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL1, and
             $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL2 command equates for the ADMCOMMAND
             statement.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBEQU.INC - Updated the subtype equates to include new object types.
 
           - Added new property descriptions for COMBOBOX, DATALIST,
             EDITNUMBER, and EDITTEXT.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBMETH.INC- Added new object methods for COMBOBOX, EDITNUMBER, & EDITTEXT.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUNFHSYS.DLL- Corrected a problem where a record in a TXT data file
              could be changed unexpectedly when the following instruction
              sequence was executed:
 
               1. A sequential READ of an AFILE/IFILE that gives an OVER
                  flag because the end of file was encountered.
 
               2. The OVER flag is ignored.
 
               3. An UPDATE of the AFILE/IFILE would execute and change
                  a record in the data file unexpectedly.
 
              With this correction implemented, then this same sequence of
              instructions cause an I40 error on the UPDATE instruction.

ADMIN    - Modified the ADMCOMMAND statement to accept 3 new {command} values
           to allow information to be logged into the server log file.
           These commands can be used to store data into the PLBSERVE or
           the SUNFM server log files.
 
           The new {command} values are as follows:
 
           $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL0 is a command that causes the {value} data
                               to be stored into the server log file with
                               a logging level 0 used.
 
                               $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL0  EQU  8
 
           $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL1 is a command that causes the {value} data
                               to be stored into the server log file with
                               a logging level 1 used.
 
                               $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL1  EQU  9
 
           $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL2 is a command that causes the {value} data
                               to be stored into the server log file with
                               a logging level 2 used.
 
                               $ADMCMDLOGMSGLEVEL2  EQU  10
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUNIDE   - Fixed a problem when saving the editor settings where incorrect font
	   information may be saved.

	 - Fixed a bug that was introduced in 8.7B where the IDE would get
	   stuck in an infinite loop adding bogus sources to the project. (the
	   "OO" bug)

	 - Added module name detection to correct a problem interfacing the
	   editor when the PLB_FNC keyword was defined as mixed.

	 - Corrected a problem where errors that may be reported at the end of
	   the compile may not be detected.

	 - Fixed a bug were labels were not being processed properly while
	   processing the source list file.

	 - Fixed a problem were a project could be added to the recent projects
	   list multiple times if the path was mixed case.

	 - Modified configuration file location to be user specific. The IDE
	   now uses the Windows Application Data folder for them.

	 - Various list file processing optimizations.

	 - Modified the load errors and browse info to support "XE" (errors
	   only/cross reference) list file as well as full source lists.
	   Because a cross reference loads faster, it is now the project
	   settings default compiler option for new projects.

	 - Corrected a bug where if the IDE configured runtime/compiler did not
	   contain an EXE extension, the project specified ini file could be
	   spliced into the middle of the command line.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WATCH    - Corrected computation of client and server version numbers for
	   display.

	 - Added Trap Object logic to handle communication failures gracefully.

	 - Modified the message window to move the focus as messages are added.
