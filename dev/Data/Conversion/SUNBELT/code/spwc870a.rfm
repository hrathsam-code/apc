Patch RELEASE 8.7A Runtime Files
 
*==============================================================================
Notes for some NEW Items:
 
         - Added new SPLITTER object.
 
         - Added new PANEL object.
 
         - Added new DOCK property.
 
         - Added new DOCKPADB, DOCKPADL, DOCKPADR, and DOCKPADT properties.
 
         - Added new MINEXTRA and MINSIZE properties.
 
*==============================================================================
Notes for WARNINGS:
 
         - The 8.7A PLBWIN and SUNFHSYS versions can not be used with any
           prior released versions.  A U40 error will occur if the 8.7A
           Sunfhsys.dll version is used with an older release that
           causes a conflict.  If the 8.7A PLBWIN is used with an older
           version of Sunfhsys.dll, then the following Windows OS error 
           will occur:
 
            "Plbwin.exe - Entry Point Not Found!
             The procedure entry point FhSetPlbCurDir could not be 
             located in the dynamic link library Sunfhsys.dll."
 
*==============================================================================
Notes for DOCUMENTATION:
 
         - For the PICT object note item number 4, the LZW and Packbits
           compression methods should be identified as separate methods.
 
         - Please remove the 'PLBWIN_MAXPROGVMEM' keyword from the PL/B
           reference manual.  This keyword was removed in release 8.6A and
           replaced with command line '-mv' option.
 
*==============================================================================
    The following files have been changed as follows:
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBSERVE - Modified the Application Server to allow print spooling to occur
           at the system where the server is being executed.  By default
           PRINT and SPLOPEN print operations are executed at the client
           workstation.  A new keyword named 'PLBCS_APSPOOL={0|1|2}' has
           been added to change the default operations of the PLBSERVE server
           for printing.  In addition, a new keyword named '*APSPOOL={0|1|2}'
           has been added for GETMODE/SETMODE statements to allow a program
           to control the default operations of the PLBSERVE server for
           printing.  The following table shows the expected print spooling
           operations with and without the new keywords.
 
           Note:
                1. With this change the '!' character can be included as
                   the first character of a spool name.  For PLBSERVE
                   runtimes the '!' character always indicates that the
                   spooled file/device exists at the client workstation
                   and the '!' character is not part of the filename.
                   For PLBWIN/PLB runtimes a leading '!' character in the
                   file name is ignored and it is not part of the file name.
 
           Without New Keywords (Default actions)
 
               PRINT     - Default printing is performed at the client.
               SPLOPEN   - All spooling operations occur at the client.
 
           With 'PLBCS_APSPOOL=0' or 'SETMODE *APSPOOL=0'
 
               PRINT     - Default printing is performed at the client.
               SPLOPEN   - All spooling operations occur at the client.
 
           With 'PLBCS_APSPOOL=1' or 'SETMODE *APSPOOL=1'
 
               PRINT     - Default printing is performed at the client
                           when the printer device is set to be 'LPT(1-4):'
                           in the screen definition file. If the screen
                           definition file is changed to specify some
                           other file name for a print device, then printing
                           output is stored into the file at the server.
 
               SPLOPEN   - All spooling operations for files occur at the
                           server except if the file named is 'LPT(1-4):'.
                           If a name 'LPT(1-4):' is specified, then the
                           print spooling operation is performed at the
                           client workstation.
 
           With 'PLBCS_APSPOOL=2' or 'SETMODE *APSPOOL=2'
 
               PRINT     - Default printing is performed at the server.
               SPLOPEN   - All spooling operations occur at the server.
 
         - Added a new keyword named 'PLBCS_LOGMAX=nnnnn' for the application
           server INI file.  The 'nnnnn' value for this keyword specifies
           a maximum number of records that can be added to the log file.  If
           this keyword is not specified or the 'nnnnn' value is set to
           zero, then an unlimited number of records will be written to the
           log file.  However, if the 'nnnnn' value is set to a non-zero
           value, then the value specifies the maximum number of records
           that will be written to the log file.  When the maximum record
           count is exceeded, then records are over written after the
           header at the beginning of the log file in a circular manner.
 
         - The format of the Application Server has been changed as follows:
 
             1. Each record has a fixed length of 79 characters.  Log
                records longer than 79 characters will wrap to the next
                log record.  Records larger than 158 characters are truncated.
 
             2. Each record has a field format as follows:
 
                  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS NNNN L DATA
 
                  Where:
 
                        YYYY-MM-DD - Current date
                        HH:MM:SS   - Current time
                        NNNN       - Admin slot identification
                        L          - Application Server log level value
                        DATA       - Log data
 
         - The Windows Application Server has been modified to detect a
           program IP (Instruction Pointer) value of zero to prevent a GPF
           from occurring.  When an IP value of zero is detected, the
           program thread being executed will attempt to recover a
           valid IP value before continuing.  If a valid IP value is not
           available, then the program thread is terminated immediately.
           Information about an IP fault is logged into the Application
           Server log file.  If the program is terminated, then a program
           image file is created with a name as 'CodePtr_NNNN.IMG'.  The
           NNNN string identifies the thread id that had the fault.
 
         - Modified the PLBSERVE server runtime to prevent the program
           from terminating at the 256 instruction check event point when
           the PLBCLIENT has prematurely terminated.  This change means
           that a program will only terminate after a PLBCLIENT process
           has prematurely terminated when the PLBSERVE executes a PL/B
           statement that requires access to the client workstation.  This
           change is implemented as per user's request that the server
           program should be able to continue processing file updates after
           the PLBCLIENT workstation connection has terminated.  It is the
           user's responsibility to insure that a program does not have
           any endless loops in a program that prevents access to a
           PLBCLIENT workstation.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a GPF could occur when multiple PL/B
           debug sessions were performing TP actions at the same time.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the OBJECTID property for a CHECKGRP
           and RADIOGRP object was not being set by a CREATE statement.
           Performing EVENTINFO or GETPROP operations to retrieve the
           OBJECTID was returning a zero value.
 
         - Corrected a GPF problem that could occur when a FORMLOAD
           operation was performed for a PLFORM depending on how the 
           Windows OS allocated memory buffers.  This problem was most
           likely to occur when the PLFORM included TOOLBAR or STATUSBAR
           objects.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBCLIENT- Added new keyword named 'PLBCS_CMDLN={prog}' that can be placed
PLBCLICON  into the 'PLBCLIENT.INI'.  This keyword can be specified to
           give the default command line to be executed by PLBCLIENT.EXE
           when no command line parameters are given.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the client module could get a GPF error
           when a '.BMP' image could not be found when executing an
           AddBmpMasked method for an IMAGELIST object.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBSERVE - A new keyword named 'PLB_CURDIR={path}' has been added for the
PLBWIN     Windows version of the runtimes.  Also, a new keyword
           named '*PLBCURDIR={svar}' has been added for the GETMODE/SETMODE
           statements.  The runtime '-z{path}' runtime option also can
           be used.  The need for he PLB_CURDIR directory is to address
           a Windows OS multiple thread issue where a change to the
           current working directory affects all of the threads.  This
           problem can occur for the Application Server or the Automation
           Server when a PL/B application requires unique working directories
           for all threads.
 
           Any time that the PL/B current directory is set, then the
           runtime will perform the following actions when executing a
           program:
 
              1. The PL/B current directory is used as the default directory
                 for all OPEN or PREP operations when a path is not
                 specified in the file name.
 
              2. The PL/B current directory is used as the default directory
                 when an BATCH/EXECUTE/ROLLOUT instruction is executed.
 
              3. When the PL/B current directory is used/specified, the
                 PATH CHANGE instruction will only change the PL/B
                 current directory.  If the PL/B current directory is
                 NOT used/specified when the PATH CHANGE is executed,
                 then only the OS working directory is set.
 
              4. When the PL/B current directory is used/specified, the
                 PATH CURRENT instruction will return the PL/B current
                 directory buffer string.  If the PL/B current directory
                 buffer is not used/specified, then the PATH CURRENT
                 returns the current OS working directory.
 
              5. When the PL/B current directory is used/specified, the
                 PATH CREATE instruction will use the PL/B current directory
                 when the user specified string does not specify a 
                 pathed name.
 
              6. When the PL/B current directory is used/specified, the
                 PATH DELETE instruction will use the PL/B current directory
                 when the user specified string does not specify a
                 pathed name.
 
         - Corrected a problem where data could be displayed on the wrong
           line after a SCRNRESTORE or STATERESTORE operation.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBWIN   - Corrected a problem where function key flags were being cleared
PLBSERVE   when executing under the PLBDBUG debugger and a 'STOP IF FKEY'
PLB:UNIX   statement was executed where a CHAIN is not performed.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a CHAIN statement was not clearing
           a FKEY (function key flag).
 
         - Corrected a problem where an indeterminate/unknown program error
           would occur if the S$RETVAL value was greater than 255 when
           a program performed a SHUTDOWN.
 
         - Corrected an I80 error that could occur while executing a
           REPOSIT instruction.  The following code would cause the
           problem with a file size of 256 bytes.  This error actually
           can occur when the true file size is less than a position
           value used for the first REPOSIT file position.
 
                  $0      INTEGER   0
                  $1135h  INTEGER   4,"0x1135"
                  FILE    FILE
                  .
                          OPEN      FILE....
                  .
                          REPOSIT   FILE,$1135h
                          REPOSIT   FILE,$0
                          REPOSIT   FILE,$1135h    ;I80 error occurs!
 
         - Corrected a problem where an invalid generic string property
           for a Gui object was being reported as an O105 error in a
           GETPROP operation.  This error has been changed to be an O123
           error.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a F04 error would occur when a program
           was compiled using the 'zc=3' compiler option and a CALL USING
           list operand was a whole reference array and the ROUTINE list
           operand was an array of pointers.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBWIN   - Modified the BATCH, EXECUTE, ROLLOUT, and SHUTDOWN statements to
           automatically attempt to use the current COMSPEC keyword command
           after a user specified command line fails to execute.  The format
           of the second execution attempt in this case would be as follows:
 
              EXECUTE  "User Command"  ;If execution fails, then automatic
                                       ;retry as '%COMSPEC% /c User Command'
 
         - SPLITTER Object (NEW)
 
           A new GUI object named SPLITTER has been added for Windows
           runtimes.  The SPLITTER object enables the user, at runtime, to
           resize an object that is docked to the edge of the SPLITTER
           object.  When the user passes the mouse pointer over the SPLITTER
           object, the cursor changes to indicate that the object can be
           resized.  The SPLITTER object enables the user to resize the
           docked object that has the same docking type and is immediately
           before it in z-order.  To enable the user to resize a docked
           object, dock the object you want the user to be able to
           resize, and then dock a SPLITTER to the same value.  When the
           mouse pointer is over a SPLITTER object and the mouse pointer
           is set to the resize indicator, then a user can click and hold
           the left mouse button.  This causes the splitter bar to be
           activated where it can be moved to a new desired location.

           A new GUI object named PANEL has been added for Windows runtimes.
           The PANEL object is an object that can contain other objects,
           just as a WINDOW contains other objects.  When an object is
           created in a PANEL object, it belongs to that PANEL object and
           will be enabled, disabled, hidden, made visible, or destroyed
           when one of these actions take place on the PANEL object.

           Statements Supported:
 
            CREATE  SETPROP  GETPROP
 
           Description:
 
                 This property allows an object to be anchored to one
                 or more edges of its parent object.  The parent object
                 can be either a Window or Panel object. Anchoring an object
                 to its parent ensures that the anchored edges remain in
                 the same position relative to the edges of the parent
                 container when it is resized.  By default objects are
                 anchored to the top/left.  The possible anchor values
                 are as follows:
 
                   $ANCHORBL       - Bottom, Left
                   $ANCHORBLR      - Bottom, Left/Right
                   $ANCHORBR       - Bottom, Right
                   $ANCHORTBL      - Top/Bottom, Left
                   $ANCHORTBLR     - Top/Bottom, Left/Right
                   $ANCHORTBR      - Top/Bottom, Right
                   $ANCHORTL       - Top, Left

         - The DOCK property has been modified to support a $DOCKFULL mode.
           In addition, the DOCK property has been added to more objects.
 
             $DOCKFULL - The object takes up the rest of the docking space.

         - Added the AUTOREDRAW property for the TREEVIEW object.
 
         - Modified the SortColumn method for a LISTVIEW object to preserve
           the checkbox states when the CHECKBOX property is set true.
 
         - Modified the LISTVIEW to update the colors for a line item when
           the text in a subitem was modified.
 
         - It was reported that a program executed on a Windows 98/NT system
           would go into an infinite loop when color control columns were
           added.  This problem could not be reproduced on several Windows
           98 systems available to the Sunbelt staff.  However, in response
           to the reported issue the LISTVIEW object logic was modified to
           try and eliminate any possible cases of infinite loops when
           processing color control columns.
 
         - Corrected a PostScript printer color printing problem for
           advanced printing.  The problem occurred because the data
           returned from the PostScript printer driver was causing the
           runtime to identify the printer as a non-colored printer.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the BDRSTYLE property was not being
           processed in a CREATE statement for a TOOLBAR.
 
         - Corrected a F05 error that would occur when a CALL using operand
           was a GUI MAINWINDOW object and the ROUTINE operand was a GUI
           WINDOW object pointer.
 
         - Corrected a F05 error that would occur when a CALL using operand
           was a GUI object (any type) and the ROUTINE operand was a VAR
           typeless variable.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the 8.7 PLBWIN runtime could not be
           loaded and executed on a Windows 95 system that did not provide
           the "Windows Socket 2" support.  The 8.7A PLBWIN runtime has 
           been modified to detect when "Windows Socket 2" support is not
           available and then load the runtime without ADMIN services.  The
           ADMIN services are used to monitor Automation Server threads.
 
           One of the Sunbelt users has reported that there is a Microsoft
           upgrade file named 'WS2SETUP.EXE' that upgrades a Windows 95
           system to provide the "Windows Socket 2" capability.  This
           could allow a Windows 95 system to be upgraded so that
           the 8.7 PLBWIN runtime will load and provide full ADMIN services
           needed to support Automation Server.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a WINDOW object was being created with
           a larger size than expected when a CAPTION property was set off.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLB:UNIX - Modified the GETFILE NAMETYPE keyword to return a value of
            3 when a UNIX runtime is being used.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBCMP   - Modified the compiler to give a syntax error when a generic
           property string format is used in a CREATE/GETPROP/SETPROP
           statement for any GUI objects except for AUTOMATION, CONTAINER,
           CONTROL, and VARIANT. This helps prevent situations where a
           generic property syntax problem could only be detected when
           the program was executed.                       
 
           Example:
                      SETPROP    BUTTON,*ENABLED=0   ;Gives compiler error!
 
                      SETPROP    BUTTON,ENABLED=0    ;Valid syntax format!
 
         - Modified the nested INCLUDE levels supported from 4 to 8 levels.
 
         - Modified the CREATE statement syntax to accept a PANEL object
           as the parent object.  This syntax change applies to all objects
           that can be created with a parent window.
 
           Format:
                  [label] CREATE [{window}|{panel};]{object}....
 
         - Added support for new SPLITTER object.
 
         - Added support for new PANEL object.
 
         - Added support for new DOCK property.
 
         - Added support for new DOCKPADB, DOCKPADL, DOCKPADR, and 
           DOCKPADT properties.
 
         - Added support for new MINEXTRA and MINSIZE properties.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the compiler was prematurely
           terminating with an I10 error when a user was using the
           'PLB_OPENABS=ON' keyword.
 
         - Corrected a DIM array syntax error that would occur when using
           the 'zc#3' option.  The following statement was causing
           an erroneous compilation error when using this option.
 
                 Label  DIM  1(2):
                              ("a"):
                              ("b")
 
         - Corrected a problem where an underscore character ('_') was
           causing a compilation error when it existed in a MACRO
           opcode name.
 
         - Corrected a F02 compiler error that would prematurely terminate
           the compiler.  This could occur when an invalid variable was
           encountered when a LIST definition was active.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBDSIGN - Added a new Tool\Options checkbox 'Save File in Ansi'. When
           this option is unchecked, then PLF form program code is translated
           from ANSI to OEM data before it is written into the PLF form. If
           this option is checked, then PLF form program code is NOT 
           translated and ANSI international data characters are written
           into the PLF form.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the &OBJNAME macro was not expanded
           properly into an object name.  This was causing a compilation
           error to occur because an object name was truncated.
 
         - Corrected a problem where the current working directory for 
           the designer was being changed when a form resource was added
           to a PLF form.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a WINDOW object was being created with
           a larger size than expected when a CAPTION property was set off.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UTILITY  - Corrected a problem where the 8.7 SUNAAMDX.EXE utility did not
           execute properly when redirected key input was used as follows:
 
               sunaamdx file.txt,,l20;: <keys.txt
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLBWSEC  - Corrected a problem where the security DLL was not recognizing
           multiple load instances of PLBWIN.  This could cause erroneous
           U21 Subcode 2 errors to occur.  The user can use the '-v'
           option for the runtime and verify that the PLBWSEC.DLL date is
           '87A 03/20/2003' to identify a corrected version.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUNFHSYS - Modified spool printing functions to support spooled output
           at the Application Server system as per the PLBCS_APSPOOL
           keyword setting.
 
         - Corrected a problem where a REPOSIT could cause an I80 error.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ADMIN    - Modified the server logging support to format server log messages
           as fixed length records.  This change is used to support new
           ADMGETINFO data types.  The following admin server data types
           have been added for the ADMGETINFO statement:
 
           $ADMITEMSRVLOGCUR specifies that the current log record number
                             for the server log file is to be returned.
                             The record number returned is a one-based value.
 
                             $ADMITEMSRVLOGCUR      EQU   110
 
           $ADMITEMSRVLOGMAX specifies that the maximum allowed record count
                             value is to be returned.  If the returned value
                             is zero, then an unlimited number of records
                             are being logged.  The server FM_LOGMAX or
                             PLBCS_LOGMAX keywords controls this value.
 
                             $ADMITEMSRVLOGMAX      EQU   111
 
           $ADMITEMSRVLOGSTART specifies the starting record number of the
                               user data records in the log file.  The
                               value is one based and identifies the first
                               user data record after the server header
                               information records.
 
                             $ADMITEMSRVLOGSTART    EQU   112
 
           $ADMITEMSRVLOGRECS specifies that log file records are to be
                              returned.  The <mask> parameter, in this
                              case, identifies a starting record number and
                              a record count to be retrieved.  The <mask>
                              string in this case is specified as follows:
 
                              nnnn,mmmm
 
                              Where:
                                    nnnn - identifies the starting record.
 
                                    mmmm - identifies the number of records
                                           to retrieve.
 
                              Note:
                                   1. Log records are packed into the result
                                      operand as data groups separated by
                                      a ';' character that represents an EOR;
 
                             $ADMITEMSRVLOGRECS     EQU   113
 
         - The ADMSETINFO statement has been modified to support a new
           <action> named $ADMLOG.  The <action> value for the $ADMLOG
           is a value of 4.  The $ADMLOG action will cause the <value>
           string to be placed into the server's log file.  This action
           command can be used to store application log records directly 
           into the log file of a server.
 
                             $ADMLOG   EQU   4
 
         - Corrected a problem where an ADMGETINFO statement that retrieved
           more than 1024 bytes could cause indeterminate operations.  This
           included the possibility of hanging a server application.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUNIDE   - Fixed a bug where compiler -E= option wasn't picking up the leading
           dot "." on the extension.

	 - Fixed a bug where if a user defined extension was specified,
	   filenames were built without the extension delimiter.

	 - Added option to not show the IDE logo.

	 - Fixed a bug where you could get multiple editor property windows.

	 - Fixed a bug where new dependencies were not being processed.

	 - Fixed a bug where an external editor would launch after stripping
	   the path from a file name.  This could  cause the external editor
	   to not find the file.

	 - Fixed a problem where we were not looking for equated labels in INI
	   compiler options.

	 - Fixed a bug in Save Project As where a corrupt project file could be
	   saved.

	 - Added option to delete the make file when the IDE is finished with
	   it.

	 - Fixed a bug where some items on the project menu could be enabled
	   with no project file open.

	 - Added option to refresh dependencies to the TreeView right click and
	   on the project menu.

	 - Corrected a problem where if an error occurs while defining a new
	   project, the new project dialog would close so a user would have to
	   start over.

	 - All IDE working scratch file names are now generated to be unique
	   based on a time stamp.

	 - The IDE now checks the version of the editor loadmod and gives a
	   warning if a version other than expected is found.

	 - Added override for PLB_SKIPFOCUS keyword because the IDE needs this
	   events to restore state when re-activating. This is to try to
	   address the issue where after the compiler executes, the window with
	   focus may be indeterminate and tabs could be arbitrarily be added to
	   a source.

	 - Fixed a bug where if a source file was specified on the command
	   line, the file could get truncated.

	 - Fixed a problem where the working directory may not be properly
	   stripped from a file name during makefile generation.

	 - Modified the IDE to use splitters and panels and removed docking
	   code and nearly 200 lines of child window updating code.

	 - Fixed a bug where indeterminate results could occur if a nested
	   include was the updated file that caused a compile.

	 - Fixed a bug where an include could be mistaken for program's main
	   source after a compile.

	 - Added path squashing so the file name should always be visible on
	   the status dialog during project opens and compiles

	 - Made the Browse Labels tab sort the labels case insensitive

	 - Fixed save all to detect if a save is canceled or fails.

	 - Fixed build operation so if a save canceled or the editor fails to
	   save at least one file, the build aborts.

	 - Fixed a bug in the line parser where a comment after the second
	   parameter in an IFEQ/XIF was being treated as part of the label to
	   compare which would result in a bogus false if.  This resulted in
	   some conditional includes not being picked up by the IDE.

	 - Fixed a bug in the line parser that would pick up a variable called
	   "INC" as an include directive when it is the first variable after a
	   line continuation.

	 - Added logic to clear events when an MDIChild window gets focus to
	   try to prevent bogus tabs from getting entered into the editor.

	 - The dependency resolver was optimized to eliminate code and run
	   faster.  It also eliminates an infinite loop problem where a program
	   could be copied to a project file several times.

	 - Fixed a bug in printing where data would run off the end of the page
	   (approximately 1" worth) to the right and bottom of the printable
