Release: PLBWIN Version 8.7
 
NOTES:
 
    Due to enhancements in PLB, it became necessary to drop support for PLB386.
    This was a runtime designed to run in DOS mode with a 16 bit file system.
    PLBCON has effectively replaced it, has more capabilities and runs a lot
    faster.
    
    Also please note that effective with this release cross platform file
    access is no longer supported.  This means that if you have UNIX and
    Windows systems linked together we will no longer support both accessing
    the same files.  As we have worked on problems in this area it has become
    obvious that there are too many inconsistencies to work around.  We have
    other solutions, that being either the Sunbelt File Manager and/or the
    Sunbelt Application Server to address these needs.  These are fully
    supported and work quite well as they are running natively on the supported
    platform.
 
TRAINING:
 
    Sunbelt has several courses to assist in learning either PL/B or
    PL/B for Windows.  These are taught on a regular schedule and can be
    invaluable for learning some of the newer features or techniques of
    the language.  Contact either sales, support or check out our web site for
    more information on class content and current schedule.
