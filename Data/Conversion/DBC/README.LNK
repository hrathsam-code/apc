To install SQL, CCALL, CVERB, native I/O,  or special
communications routines, you will need to re-link DBC.  The
object files needed are contained on your distribution
media.  Copy these files into the directory in which you
will be working.

A 'makefile' has been included on the distribution.  It is
named 'makefile.dbc'.  You may want to rename makefile.dbc
to Makefile or makefile.  The makefile contains the linking
commands necessary to relink DB/C.

The following table shows which module name must be changed
in the makefile in order to replace the default module with
a custom module provided by the user.

               Module           |   Default Module Name
            ===========================================
             Null SQL           |   sqlnull.o
             Debugger           |   dbcdbg.o
             Null Debugger      |   dbgnull.o
             Communications     |   comunx.o
             Null Communcations |   comnull.o
             Null CVERB         |   cverb.o
             Null CCALL         |   ccall.o


The makefile contains two different configurations:
     dbc & dbcsmall

The user can type:
     make dbc
       or
     make dbcsmall

This will cause the default version of DB/C to be relinked
WITH communications and the debugger in the first case and
WITHOUT communications and the debugger in the second case.

To install SQL, CCALL, CVERB or special communications
routines, you will need to re-link DBC.EXE.  The object
files needed are contained on the last disk of your
distribution.  Copy these files into the directory in which
you will be working.

Procedure 1:  Compiling and linking a new CCALL, CVERB, COM
     or NIO module with DB/C.

     1) You must use Microsoft C version 5.1.  Be sure that
     it is set up correctly.

     2) Compile your routine using the following command
     line:
               CL -c -W2 -Oati -Gs -AL filename.c

        where filename.c is the name of your C source
     program.

     3) The file DBCLINK specifies the object files that are
     linked together to make the new DBC.EXE.  In this file,
     change the name CCALL.OBJ, COM.OBJ or NIO.OBJ,
     CVERB.OBJ to the name of the file compiled in step 2.

     4) Link DBC.EXE using the following command line:

              LINK /E @DBCLINK,.\DBC.EXE;

Procedure 2:  Linking SQL-ORACLE routines with DB/C

     1) Create an ORACLE Pro*C program.

     2) Run your program through PCC.EXE as described in the
     Pro*C User Guide to obtain a C source program using the
     value 130 for the IRECLEN and ORECLEN command line
     options.

     3) Compile the resulting C source program using the
     following command line:

               CL -c -W2 -Oati -Gs -AL filename.c

        where filename.c is the name of the C source program
     created by PCC.

     4) The file DBCLINK specifies the object files that are
     linked together to make the new DBC.EXE.  In this file,
     change the name SQLNULL.OBJ to the name of the file
     compiled in step 3.

     5) Link DBC.EXE using the following command line:

      LINK /E /SE:512 /ST:10000
     @DBCLINK,.\DBC.EXE,,c:\ORACLE5\PRO\SQLMSC.LIB;

      If your Oracle library is not in
     C:\ORACLE5\PRO\SQLMSC.LIB then
      you must change the LINK command line appropriately.


Procedure 3:  Linking a small version of DBC.EXE

It is possible to make a version of DBC.EXE that requires
     less memory at run-time.  The following procedure will
     remove communications and/or the Source Debugger from
     the DBC.EXE.

     1) The file DBCLINK specifies the object files that are
     linked together to make the new DBC.EXE.  In this file,
     change the name COM.OBJ to COMNULL.OBJ and/or change
     the name DBCDBG.OBJ to DBGNULL.OBJ.

     2) Link DBC.EXE using the following command line:

              LINK /E @DBCLINK,.\DBC.EXE;

     3) Using the EXEMOD utility from the Microsoft C
     package, examine the Hex field of the Minimum
     Allocation (para) field for your DBC.EXE.  Add HEX 40
     to this number and use EXEMOD to change the Maximum
     Allocation (para) field to the number calculated above.
